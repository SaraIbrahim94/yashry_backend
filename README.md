------------------------------------------------------

A fully backend project that dealing with data using API
i used native API although I am much expiranced with Codeigniter Framework but i choosed this because it's more easier to setup for you as i faced this problem before with another company.

please note that i attached .pdf documentaion with fully detailed steps on the project and how to deal with it.

please note that once you start this project the tables will be added automatically, but you need first to add new database in you phpmyadmin panel named cart_db.

all you need to run this project is XAMPP as host server and create new database
